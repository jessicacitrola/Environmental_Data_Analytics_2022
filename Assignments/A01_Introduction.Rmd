> Answer: I have taken Applied Data Analysis (ENV 710) where we used R studio.

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I feel like I may have a head start on some tasks as I feel like ENV 710 gave me some experience on modeling, statistics, and general R use. 

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I am apprehensive overall about the course as I thought the R labs in my last course were a bit confusing and extremely time consuming. But I am hopeful that I will get a better understanding of R through this course.
